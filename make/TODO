Ways to improve on NMAKE:
- Find a way to execute preprocessor CreateProcess calls in parallel
- A dependency-aware way to describe install, so $(BINDIR)\foo.exe: foo.exe,
  and it's only copied if the source has changed.  The challenge is that this
  is for a list of targets
- Heuristic search for targets ("ymake yedit")
