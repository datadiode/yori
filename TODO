v1.6:
 - General MSFIX review
 - Explicit Ctrl+C by detecting console process before launch, if not console
   process on same console don't use GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent
 - Tab completion on %i
 - "."=="." becomes ".=="."" due to quote parsing which confuses if badly

To consider:
 - Use CopyFileEx when compressing to eliminate CreateFile?
 - Colorize help and error text
 - Ctrl+R
 - Edit horizontal scroll bar
 - More select should use logical line coordinates rather than conhost
   buffer coordinates to allow selection beyond screen size
 - Attempt to use dbghelp stack formatting again.  Seems useful for ydbg
   to be able to output the stack of exceptions etc.

v2.0:
 - Port pcre
 - Use regex in hilite
 - Case statement in ys
 - Ctrl+Z
 - Markdown formatter/parser
 - Man or something like it
 - Edit line wrap
 - Edit hex editing
 - Round braces in command parser, including if
