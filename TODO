
At this point, the TODO is more a list of tasks that might be useful and/or
fun to write.

 - Format hex strings directly without printf for performance
 - Scroll around input line on tiny windows, where the entire line doesn't
   fit in the window
 - Make more use something like line selection
 - Ctrl+R (reverse history search)
 - Direnv whitelist
 - Base64 tools (see CryptStringToBinaryW)
 - Allow pipes to be inserted into tee output
 - Start without elevation prompt
 - Have env read variable value pair from stdin
 - Use CopyFileEx when compressing to eliminate CreateFile?
 - Colorize help and error text
 - More select should use logical line coordinates rather than conhost
   buffer coordinates to allow selection beyond screen size
 - Tab completion on %i
 - Attempt to use dbghelp stack formatting again.  Seems useful for ydbg
   to be able to output the stack of exceptions etc.
 - Mini-http client to complete the NT 3.1 story and allow NT 3.5x and 4
   RTM to install without redistributables?

 - Have co and history process window manager resize so they can set a
   minimum size

 - TreeView
 - Multi-column list
 - Edit horizontal scroll bar

 - Regedit "rename" keys
 - Regedit search
 - Regedit multi-sz editor

 - Yui doesn't detect explorer already running on Windows 10
 - Yui should look deeper for background color
 - Windows 10 taskbar unhides itself very aggressively
 - Yui advertize minimize location for animation rendering
 - Find a way to restore minimized/hidden elevated windows
 - Audio mixer/volume tray
 - Run recent list and autocomplete

 - Right click for cascade, tile, etc.

Longer term, larger things:
